                        <h1 class="dish-name">Soy-Glazed Meatloaves with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes & Roasted Carrots</h1>
                        <p class="food-making-tips">
                            1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice potatoes into 1/2-inch
                            pieces. Trim, peel, and cut
                            carrots on a diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions,
                            separating whites from greens; finely
                            chop whites. Peel and finely chop garlic. 2. In a medium bowl, soak bread with 2 TBSP water
                            (4 TBSP for 4 servings);
                            break up with your hands until pasty. Stir in beef, sriracha, scallion whites, half the
                            garlic, salt (we used 3/4 tsp
                            kosher salt; 11/2 tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves (four loaves for
                            4). Place on one side of a
                            baking sheet. Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and
                            pepper. (For 4, spread
                            meatloaves out across whole sheet and add carrots to a second sheet.) Bake for 20 minutes
                            (we'll glaze the meatloaves
                            then). 3. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2
                            inches. Bring to a boil and
                            cook until very tender, 12-15 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain.
                            While potatoes cook, in a
                            small bowl, combine soy sauce, garlic powder, 1/4 cup ketchup (1/2 cup for 4 servings), and
                            2 tsp sugar (4 tsp for 4).
                            4. Once meatloaves and carrots have baked 20 minutes, remove from oven. Spoon half the
                            ketchup glaze over meatloaves
                            (save the rest for serving); return to oven until carrots are browned and tender, meatloaves
                            are cooked through, and
                            glaze is tacky, 4-5 minutes more. 5. Meanwhile, melt 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings)
                            in pot used for potatoes over
                            medium heat. Add remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add potatoes and 1/4
                            tsp wasabi. Mash, adding
                            splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as necessary until smooth. Season with salt and
                            pepper. (If you like things
                            spicy, stir in more wasabi!) 6. Divide meatloaves, mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots
                            between plates. Sprinkle with
                            scallion greens and serve with remaining ketchup glaze on the side for dipping.
